# Spammer

This works on all Linux i think, just need to have keyboard module:

$ sudo pip3 install keyboard

This just reads a text"x" file with text and write it in any chat at any speed word by word.

For Example:

text1
 |
  -- example text for testing this script

"
$ sudo python3 Spammer.py

number of text: 1

speed: 0.1
"

# press the chat box

Output(Whatsapp chat):
example
text
for
testing
this
script
